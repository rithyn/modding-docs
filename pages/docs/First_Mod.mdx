# Creating your first mod

In the Mod Code window, type the code for your first mod:

```js copy showLineNumbers
this.options = {
  root_mode: "survival",
  map_size: 30
};

this.tick = function(game) {
};
```

In newer versions of browsers' updates, you can't use the Modding Client in incognito mode anymore as they restrict some incognito features which are used by the editor.
And make sure to read all of these from the start to the end so that you won't miss any important info!
