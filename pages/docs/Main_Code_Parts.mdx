# Main Code Parts

## Options

### Definition

Stored in `this.options{:js}` is a data structure where you can set options for your custom modded game. These options are used for initializing the game when you start your mod. Changing them while the mod is running does not affect the game.

### Custom ships and custom tree

You can import ships made within the Starblast Ship Editor. Use "Mod Export" feature to export a JavaScript code snippet for the modding interface. Then paste this snipped in the coding window and add this:

```js copy
var myship_101 = "{ … … <this is your exported ship code> …";

var ships = [myship_101]; // add your ship to an array of ship

this.options = {
  root_mode: "survival",
  ships: ships,         // specifying a list of ships to complement / replace existing ships
  reset_tree: true,     // set to true if you want to remove the original ship tree, false if you just want to replace some of the ships
  map_size: 30
};

this.tick = function(game) {
};
```
Then run your mod. If your ship is set to level=1 model=1, your ship will replace the Fly. You can replace other ships in the tree in a similar way, using `reset_tree: false{:js}`. Or you can remove the original ship tree completely and provide a whole new one using `reset_tree: true{:js}`.

### Customizing the emote-chat system

The vocabulary used for the emote-chat system can be customized by setting the field `vocabulary` in the game option as follows:

```js copy
var vocabulary = [
  { text: "Hello", icon: "\u0045", key: "O" },
  { text: "Bye", icon: "\u0046", key: "B" },
  { text: "Yes", icon: "\u004c", key: "Y" },
  { text: "No", icon: "\u004d", key: "N" },

  { text: "Flower", icon: "\u{1F33B}", key: "F" },
  { text: "Snowman", icon: "\u26c4", key: "M" },
  { text: "Shark", icon: "\u{1F988}", key: "S" },
  { text: "Ghost", icon: "\u{1F47B}", key: "G" }
];

this.options = {
  vocabulary: vocabulary,
  // ...
};
```
This allows using Starblast built-in emote icons, which are listed here for reference: https://starblast.io/glyphs.html

You can also use unicode icons, here is a good source for reference: https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html

Note that wide unicode characters (using more than 2 bytes) requires a specific Javascript syntax as shown in the example above (example: `\u{1F47B}`)

### Custom asteroids maps

You can create a custom map of asteroids. This allows creating a maze for example. The custom map you provide is actually a JavaScript character string that is used to "paint" the map.

For example:

```js copy
var map =
"999999999999999999999999999999\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"99                          99\n"+
"999999999999999999999999999999" ;


this.options = {
  custom_map: map,
  map_size: 30
}
```
In the example above, 9 sets the biggest size of the asteroid. You can use smaller values for adding smaller asteroids to the grid. Any value other than a digit will be interpreted as no asteroid. If your `map_size` is set to 30, make sure to create 30 lines and 30 columns, or you may get unpredictable results.

Note: Use `""` for blank custom map

You can use [Online Map Editor](https://bhpsngum.github.io/starblast/mapeditor/) (a community tool) to create, edit and export maps.

### Other common options

Most of the options are inherited from the usual custom games. A few more options have been added, specifically for modding (top of the list):

Please [[Easter Eggs#Battle of Titans|see here]] for more information. |

Example:

```js copy
ship_groups: [
  ["U-Sniper","Howler"],
  ["Crusader","Pioneer"]
]
