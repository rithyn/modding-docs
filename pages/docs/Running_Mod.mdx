# Running and testing a mod

## Change region

Once your mod code is ready, in the console, start by selecting your preferred region for modding using the command region `region <region name>`.
For example with Europe:

```sh
> region Europe
Region set to Europe
> █
```
## Start mod

Then to start running your mod, type command `start`:

```sh
> start
Mod started
https://starblast.io#1234@12.34.56.78:2000
Use 'test' to open game frame for testing
> █
```

# Test the mod

As instructed by the console, you may want to open a test window to join your modded game with a Starblast client. Type `test`:
```sh
> test
> █
```

 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
**ALWAYS keep the Mod Editor Tab being active while running the mod!**

This is one of the most important things you need to keep in your mind!

**Why?** Because that's nuances of how browsers work.

Browsers slow down all javascript in non-active tabs in order to decrease the CPU processes.
For some mods (e.g Battle Royale), it doesn't matter like with ship tree and options only,
but for other mods where some logic in tick function or events - it will affect them **A LOT!**

Ticks start to work slower and slower...

Soon everything will be lagging in game; any reactions on mod buttons, any mod logic like spawning something in tick, etc.
And... depending on mod complexity it can **CRASH THE ENTIRE MOD** - locally, server will continue to work so game will still run but without mod logic anymore.
So, always keep the mod editor tab online or you may have unpredictable results!

Also, you need to have a stable internet connection if you don't want your mods becoming laggy.

## Stop the currently running mod

You can stop your mod anytime by using the command `stop`. Note that this will kill the game and disconnect all connected players:

```sh
> stop
Mod stopped
> █
```
