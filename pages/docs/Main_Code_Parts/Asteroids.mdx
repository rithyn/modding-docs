## Asteroids
You can access the list of moving asteroids through the array `game.asteroids`

You can also find an asteroid with a specific id using `game.findAsteroid(id){:js}`, which returns an object represents the matched asteroid or `null` (if no asteroids are matching the provided id)
### Creation
To create an asteroid, use `game.addAsteroid({ options }){:js}`.

Here is the list of accepted options:

(Note: Server will respond with `Incorrect data` when at least one input property value is improper)

| Option | Description | Default value (if omitted) |
| - | - | - |
| x | X coordinate | 0 |
| y | Y coordinate | 0 |
| vx | Velocity vector X component | 0 |
| vy | Velocity vector Y component | 0 |
| size | Size of the asteroid in the range [1-100] | 30 |

A new `Asteroid` object is immediately added to `game.asteroids` ; however, it cannot be used before it has been assigned an id (natural number, a.k.a non-negative integer) by the server.

### Limits
You can only have **300** alive asteroids (including moving asteroids generated by the game mode) at any time in your game

The server will respond with `Too many asteroids` for each asteroid passing the limit

### Accessible fields
For each asteroid object in `game.asteroids`, You have access to the same properties as the available ones when you add asteroids, plus some additional properties:

| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| game | Points to the global `game` object |
| id | a unique identifier for the asteroid |

### Configuration
Once an asteroid is live and has an assigned id, you can set options to it. For example:
```js
> game.asteroids[0].set({x:0,y:0});
> â–ˆ
```
Will move the first asteroid in the list to the center of the map

List of accepted options when using `asteroid.set`:

| Option | Description | Server response error message (if improper) |
| - | - | - |
| x | X coordinate | Wrong coordinate |
| y | Y coordinate | Wrong coordinate |
| vx | Velocity vector X component | Wrong coordinate |
| vy | Velocity vector Y component | Wrong coordinate |
| size | Asteroid size in the range [1-100] (note that changing asteroid size resets its life points) | Incorrect size |
| kill | Set `kill: (any "truthy" value, e.g: true)` to destroy the asteroid | No violation |
