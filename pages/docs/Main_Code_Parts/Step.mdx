## Game step
### Definition
Can be accessible through `game.step`; an integer presenting the game's duration
### Unit
The unit of this value is tick, where 1 tick = 1/60 seconds

Which means that 60 ticks = 1 second, 120 ticks = 2 seconds and so on.
### Uses
This code uses to set the first ship in the list to the center of the map in the first minute of the mod and reset its crystals every 5 seconds (assume that there is one ship staying from the start of the mod):
```js copy
this.tick = function (game)
{
  if (game.step == 3600) { // 1 minute = 60 seconds * 60
    game.ships[0].set({x:0,y:0}); // Center teleport
  }
  if (game.step % 300 === 0) { // 5 seconds * 60
    game.ships[0].set({crystals: 0}); // Reset crystals
  }
}
```
