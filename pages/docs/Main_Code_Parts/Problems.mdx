## Common problems and how to fix them
### Black screen issue
In most cases, you're getting a black screen after loading your mod due to a bad ship tree.

Follow these rules to avoid it:

1. Your ship tree must have a ship with type/code 101.
1. If your ship tree has level 2 ships, then it should have level 1 ships too.
1. Either models should go in the right order without gaps: 1, 2, 3 etc (not 1, 6, 17) or control all ship tree routes by `next` parameter in ship codes (but keep correct order for unreachable ships).
1. You can't have possibly infinite ship tree routes, made by `next` parameters - all routes should end at some ship, there shouldn't be able to come back to some ship again.

### My mod closed accidentally but the game is not stopped
Sometimes, some unexpected problems can crash the mod, but it only disconnects from the modding side, or so-called "controller" side, the game itself will continue running without control from your modding client until it meets the closing requirements (or even in some serious occasions, game developers - like PMGL - need to close it by themselves).

Here are some reasons which can lead to mod crashing:

1. Closing/Reloading the modding tab/window without stopping the mod first (Most common one)
1. Very unstable internet connection
1. Server resolve error (which will automatically disconnect the controller by itself)
1. Browser tab hangs/crashes (careful of infinite while/for loops)

Also keep in mind that you can't reconnect to your previously crashed server, even if it's still running.
