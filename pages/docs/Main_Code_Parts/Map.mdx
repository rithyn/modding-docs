# Map

### Definition
All entities and objects in the game are moving on a 2D plane called "map"

Map can be painted with asteroids using [`this.options.custom_map`](#custom-asteroids-maps) and set size by `this.options.map_size` (even value from 20 to 200)

All Modding commands relating to coordinates will be visualized on this map
### Coordinates
#### Axes
| Axis | Direction in user screen |
| - | - |
| X | left to right |
| Y | bottom to top |
| Z | map "depth", only used for [setting 3D Objects](#add-3d-objects-to-the-scenery) |
#### Grid
The map is divided into "grids".

A Grid is a 10x10 square area which can only contain 1 static asteroid (which equals to 1 character to "paint" the map in [`this.options.custom_map`](#custom-asteroids-maps))

`map_size` is the number of grids along each dimension, which means that the number of grids in the map is calculated by the formula `map_size`<sup>2</sup>.

For example: `map_size` being 30 means that there are 30 grid length along the X Axis and Y Axis, and 30<sup>2</sup> = 900 grids total in the map
#### Center and Boundaries
Map center (x:0, y:0) is located in the Sun

Based on the [Grid definition](#Grid), we have:

Each Axis will have `map_size` / 2 grids length in both negative and positive part

Because each grid is a 10x10 square, the boundary of each part is `map_size` / 2 x 10 = `map_size` x 5

Means that each Axis varies from -`map_size` x 5 to `map_size` x 5

For example: with `map_size` = 30, each Axis in the map varies from -300 (`-60x5`) to 300 (`60x5`)
