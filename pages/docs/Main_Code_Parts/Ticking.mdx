## Ticking

### Definition

Found in `this.tick{:js}` is a JavaScript function that is called 60 times per second. In this functionâ€™s body, you will be able to code specific actions that your mod needs to take automagically while the game is running. This function can be modified while the modded game is running and the changes will apply automagically.

### Events

Your mod can receive events through the function  `this.event{:js}`:

```js copy
this.event = function(event,game) {
  switch (event.name)
  {
    case "ship_spawned":
      if (event.ship != null)
      {
        shipJustSpawned(event.ship) ;
      }
      break ;
  }
} ;
```
